For the front-end it utilizes the components from Bootstrap v5.0, HTML and CSS code written in different PHP pages. **More info in the README file**

ABOUT THIS MINI-PROJECT

This is a real world application of a database. It is a very naive representation of how the electricity supply boards generate the bills for their customers, and perform other tasks like receiving the payment of the bills from the customers
This is a mini-project which represents the database aspects of Electricity Supply like the bill generation, bill viewing, bill payment, Due/Fine Collection, adding a new user to the database, Providing new electricity meter(s) to the customers etc. This is done by using concepts like:

1. User : The end-user of electricity from the Electricity Supply Board.The user uses the electricity of the Electricity Supply Board with the help of an Electricity meter provided to him/her. An electricity meter is a simple device that shows the usage of electricity by the user by storing the previously read value(read by the reader) and the present value.The difference in these values gives the actual amount of electricity used for a particular period of time(say a month).The user can access functionalities like: 
i)   view all the bills, 
ii)  pay the unpaid bills, 
iii) view the payment information of the bills, 
iv)  change the residence address registered with the Board, and 
v)   change the password for the account with the Electricity Supply Board.

2. Reader : An employee or contract-worker of the Electricity Supply Board whose responsibility is to :
i)   read the Electricity meters of the customers
ii)  generate appropriate bills for the usage of Electricity, for a particular period of time.


3. Office Staff/Employee : An office employee of the Electricity Supply Board.
